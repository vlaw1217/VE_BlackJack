Players: 1 - 4

Card: Total 52 (Cards value 1 - 13)

Purpose: Beat the dealer (computer)

Our group chose a blackjack game for our project. This game has 52 play cards and
the card values are from 1 to 13 only. Players include a computer act as a dealer and
maximum four players in the game.

How to play:
Each player needs to beat the dealer card value on hand that is higher value than the
dealer. In the first round, the dealer would distribute the first card to all the players
including the dealer itself and all of them would know each other the card value.
Second round, the dealer would distribute the second card to all the players, but not
for the dealer itself. At this time, the dealer just has one card on hand, but the other
players have two cards on hand and if the players cards add up values are lower than
15. The Players must have more cards. However, if the two cards are 15 and over.
The player could decide to have more cards or not. After all the players have their
cards and know their cards value. The dealer would have the second card. Also, if the
dealer cards value is lower than 15, the dealer must have more cards until it is
reached to 17 and up. The final value that is less than the players, the dealer loses
the game. If the values are over 21, they all lose the game as well. If the value is 21,
they win the game right away.
